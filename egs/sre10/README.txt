 This directory (sre10) contains example scripts for the NIST SRE 2010
 speaker recognition evaluation. The following corpora are required:
    
   NIST SRE 2010 training set
   NIST SRE 2010 test set
 
 More details on NIST SRE 2010 can be found at the url
 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/sre/2010/. Additional data sources
 are required by the subdirectories. See the corresponding README.txt files 
 in the subdirectories for more details.

 The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different versions of the recipe;
 we don't call them "s1" etc., because they don't really correspond to
 the speech recognition recipes.
