Development pattern for contributors:
A) create a personal fork of the kaldi-asr/kaldi repository in github,
B) make your changes in a named branch different from "master", e.g. you create
   a branch "my-awesome-feature". 
C) generate a pull request through the web interface of github
D) as a general rule, please follow Google C++ Style Guide. There are a few 
   exceptions in Kaldi -- please consult http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/style.html
   You can use the Google's cpplint.py to verify that your code is free
   of some basic mistakes.
